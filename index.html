      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Mast Family Flowers began with our mother, Joyce Mast, gift for creating unforgettable bouquets for weddings, events and friends. For years she worked with flowers from various sources, but her dream was always to grow them herself. That dream has taken root here on our family farm, where we now cultivate vibrant, seasonal blooms just steps from our design table.</p>
      <p>In 2026 we’re opening our gates for the first full season—bringing fresh‑cut arrangements, market bouquets and event florals straight from our fields to your hands. Until then, we offer ready‑to‑go bouquets for pickup or delivery throughout Hillsboro, Beaverton and the greater Portland area.</p>
