      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Mast Family Flowers grew from our mother Joyce’s love of growing flowers in her front and back fields. As friends and neighbours began to request bouquets, Joyce dreamed of turning her passion into a small business. Today we operate as a tight‑knit family, cultivating colourful blooms through the seasons and sharing them at markets, events and right here on our farm.</p>
      <p>Our mission is simple: to make flowers accessible and enjoyable for everyone. We offer a range of ready‑to‑go bouquets, and we invite you to wander our fields and pick your own stems during special events. No matter how you choose to enjoy our flowers, you’ll feel the care and love that goes into every bloom.</p>
