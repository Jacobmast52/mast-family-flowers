      <h3>Join Us on the Farm</h3>
      <p>There’s nothing quite like wandering through a field of flowers and gathering your own bouquet. Our events are designed to be relaxed and family friendly. We provide clippers, containers and tips on harvesting – all you need to bring is your creativity and a love for blooms.</p>
